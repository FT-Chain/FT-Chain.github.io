- **Freie Universität Berlin**

FUB (Project Coordinator) is one of the eleven universities to have been successful in all three lines of funding in the German government's Excellence Initiative in 2019. The future development concept of FUB is based on three key strategic centers: the Center for Research Strategy, which focuses on research planning; the Center for International Cooperation; and the Dahlem Research School, which attracts and supports next-generation academic talent across the globe through various cooperation programs, fellow-ships, etc. The present proposal FT-Chain is driven by the newly established the [Cybersecurity and AI Group (former Heisenberg Communications and Information Theory Group)](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/ag-comm/index.html) led by Associate Professor [Dr. Gerhard Wunder](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/ag-comm/team-members/wunder.html). focusing on machine learning in networks, big data analytics, and information-theoretic security/privacy. The Heisenberg AG COMM is part of the Mathematics and Computer Science Faculty of the FUB since 2016 and the first ever of its kind in communication engineering. Since then, Heisenberg AG COMM has been part of several major H2020 flagship projects particularly within the 5G-PPP program of the European Commission such as ONE5G (5G-PPP Phase II, until end 2019) and FANTASTIC-5G (Phase I, subcontracted). Most relevant for FT-Chain is its partnership in the ongoing H2020 PhasmaFOOD project where it leads the machine learning cloud infrastructure and algorithms platform development for the food data analytics (e.g. detection of milk powder contamination, fish and meat spoilage etc., visit www.phasmafood.eu). Eventually, it is also part of ongoing DFG priority programs such as the SPP 1914 Cyber-Physical Networking (CPN, until 2023), and the SPP 1798 Compressed Sensing in Information Processing (CoSIP, until 2022) of which the outcomes are also clearly highly relevant for FT-Chain, such as sparse structured big data processing. In BMBF SecureFOG, it develops the secure IoT fog architecture for logistic use cases. Therefore, altogether, the group has built up the relevant expertise for the privacy-preserving machine learning platform to be developed in FT-Chain. The research work will further be supported by the group of Prof. Dr. M. Margraf with focus on identity management and privacy-enhancing mechanisms, as well as the group of Prof. Dr. K. Wolters with focus on blockchains.

- **VizLore Labs Foundation (VLF)**

[VizLore Labs Foundation (VLF)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vizlore-llc/) is a private non-profit organization focused on innovative projects in all IoT verticals. The mission is to lead regional ICT technology related innovation and seed entrepreneurship culture. The team comprises field experts in ICT and IoT systems, project management and business strategy development supported with experienced software and system engineers and developers. VLF operates its own IoT data analytics and machine learning cloud platform extended to the IoT edge through our universal IoT controllers. The VizLore IoT platform is focused on enhancing the way people interact with their surroundings and boosts their experience in every aspect of their daily routines. The platform comprises cloud and edge computing segments thus following state of the art thinking in distributed computing and decision making. For the last two years VLF has been pioneering R&D work related to application of distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts in all IoT domains. The VizLore IoT cloud platform and edge controllers are utilized in our R&D projects within the H2020 program most notably 3 out of 5 European IoT Platform Initiative projects – symbIoTe, AGILE IoT and Vicinity, PhasmaFOOD project where we led development of SW platform and InterConnect project were we are leading implementation of IoT and smart grid interoperability framework. VLF has close collaboration with the University of Novi Sad and organizes workshops, hackathons and lectures related to the IoT systems and platforms. Additionally, VLF closely collaborates with the CASCADE institute at Arizona State University in the domain of IoT systems for water and energy management. Finally, VLF selects among its most promising technologies/solutions to spin off and accelerate new IoT business and services and ensure business viability of its operation through related technology licensing.
